# Given an array of numbers and an index i, return the index of the nearest larger number of the number at index i, where distance is measured in array indices.

# For example, given [4, 1, 3, 5, 6] and index 0, you should return 3

#output = 3, as value at 3rd index in 5. Which is the nearest lasge number from 4.
